                    <p>“ The great love of God will change your life forever. This love is greater than anything found on Earth… Your mother may love you, your father may love you; but none of them will die for you. Your boyfriend may love you, your girlfriend may love you, but none will die for you..”
                        What Jesus is, is the embodiment of unconditional, all consuming Love. The kind of love that assures that you will live forever. Jesus’ love was so deep, that he sought to spend eternity being with us, but the Bible says in Romans 3:23, that ALL have sinned and come short of the Glory of God…” To remedy this, Jesus gave His life for us so we could have eternal life, and be with him forever.</p>

                <td>
                <p>There is not a love, quantifiable, that exists on this earth, greater than the love of God that caused Him to sacrifice his only son for us. It cannot be topped.
    
                    When you open up your heart to receive this great love, you will be Born Again. If you open up your heart to this great love from God, you will become a new creation and live a totally different life. If you open up your heart to this great love of God you will escape your punishment in Hell. What manner of love is this that we can be called the children of God? What great Salvation has been shown to us that Jesus should shed His blood to save us from our sins!</p>

            “This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you. GREATER LOVE HATH NO MAN THAN THIS, 
            that a man lay down his life for his friends. Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.

            <span>John 15:12-14</span>

The great love of God will change your life forever.  This love is greater than anything found on earth.  When a man says to a woman, “I love you”, it cannot be compared to the greater love of Jesus Christ.  Your mother may love you, your father may love you; but none of them will die for you.  Your boyfriend may love you and your girlfriend may love you, but none will die for you.

This is all about the greater love of God.  When you open up your heart to receive this great love, you will be born again.  If you open up your heart to this great love from God, you will become a new creation and live a totally different life.  If you open up your heart to this great love from God, you will escape your punishment in Hell.

The love of Jesus has lasted throughout the centuries.  It has persisted until it reached you and me.

<span>A new beginning…</span>
Jesus loves you, and He wants to spend eternity loving you. If you want to spend eternity with Him repeat this prayer, and believe it in your heart and you will be saved. Say :
Lord Jesus,
I come to you today, just as I am.
I am a Sinner. Please forgive me of all my Sins
Please write my name in the Book of Life.
From today, I belong to you. I will love you. I will serve you,
All the days of my life!
Satan! I will no longer serve you! I am not yours to command!
I love you Jesus!
Thank you for saving my soul!
